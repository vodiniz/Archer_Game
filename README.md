# Archer_Game
Hello I'm Vodiniz This is a short game that Iâ€™ve decided to make after youtube started to recommend some game jam videos, they were so
interesting and since I was learning programing, specifically python, I decided to make a little game with pygame as a learning method
and to have some fun. After some thinking I decided to remake an old windows game that I used to play with my father in my style.
The actual game is called Bow and Arrow. All the pixel art was created by me, except the romans, which my brother made for my game. 
This game can also be found at http://vodiniz.itch.io/
